# What's this project?

This is just a simple blog project to help me learn a little bit of html and css and maybe with time vanilla JavaScript.
I don't really know what I will be doing so expect a lot of errors, and of course this project should NOT be used as reference unless it a reference on how things probably should not be done.


# License

Since this project it's only for learning purposes I still don't know how to license this project... so... comming soon?
