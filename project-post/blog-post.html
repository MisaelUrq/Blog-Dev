      <h3>Why make a blog?</h3>
      <p>So, I have been learning little by little how to program for the last 2 years, the progress as been slow but steady, or at least that's what I like to belive, I have been learning mostly game engine development, but I have touch a little of other areas as well, but to be honest web development is the one thing that I skipped, and most if it is has to do with the very nature of the area.</p>
      <p>In most areas the use of tools and frameworks is expected but there's always a lot of books or articles on how things work from scratch, and I feel that I learn a lot from doing things from scratch, granded I probably will never make a user product from scratch but just doing things like that helps me learn of how things work the way they do, after all, if you don't know how they work, how will I ever know if the tool I'm using it's the right one for the job? But back to the web thingy, well... the web it's HUGE, and there's a lot of information, no matter wich topic are you looking for, so for me the web was always with a mark with the 'DO NOT ENTER' sign or a 'DEANGER ZONE AHEAD'. It may sound weird but honestly that's how it feels, how is a beginner gone learn if there's like 20+ places where's every one of them tells them to make things in diferent ways? And is not like other areas where you can simply say something like: "well, it's just tool for me, so nobody is gone see it." when you do web development one of the points it's the ability to shared fast and with at least a few other people, if not, then you probably don't need a web app in the first place.</p>
      <p>But I feel that a lot of time has pass, and now is time to give web dev a try, so I decided to start with the most easy and common thing that you can to, the thing that every tutorial makes you do (But either, really ugly or with a lot more frameworks than needed) and that's a Blog, because everybody needs one. The blog itself will only from the front-end part, meaning that I will leave all the back-end to Github, but everything else? well that's gone be done from zero and if I see that I need some help, I will write a really basic tool to help me a little. After all, I'm a student, and the best way to learn to code is to actually code. So let's see how this turn out.</p>
      <h3>What I expect to learn from this</h3>
      <p>Comming soon...</p>
